## Question 1: What is TypeScript?
TypeScript is a strongly-typed superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and additional features to the language. It provides:
- Better error checking through static typing.
- Enhanced tools for development, including autocompletion and refactoring.
- Improved code readability and maintainability.

## Question 2: What is the difference between TypeScript and JavaScript?

| Feature                        | TypeScript                                          | JavaScript                                  |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Typing                         | Statically typed (supports type annotations)      | Dynamically typed                         |
| Compilation                    | Needs to be compiled to JavaScript                | Directly executed by browsers & Node.js  |
| Error Checking                 | Compile-time error checking                       | Errors occur at runtime                  |
| Object-Oriented Programming    | Supports interfaces, classes, and generics       | Basic support with prototype-based OOP   |
| Learning Curve                 | Higher due to static typing & additional features | Easier to learn as itâ€™s simpler          |
| Scalability                    | Easier to scale with static types and interfaces  | More challenging to scale due to dynamic typing |
| Compatibility                  | Can use JavaScript libraries and code            | Fully interoperable with TypeScript      |
| Performance                    | Slower due to type checking and compilation       | Faster since no compilation is required  |
| Adoption                       | Growing, especially for large-scale apps         | Large and well-established               |
| Tooling                        | Rich tooling support with autocompletion & refactoring | Basic tooling support                  |
| Feature Set                    | Includes all ES6+ features & future proposals    | Includes ES6+ features, but limited by environment |
