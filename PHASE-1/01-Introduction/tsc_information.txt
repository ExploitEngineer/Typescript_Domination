1. What is TypeScript ?
TypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a superset of JavaScript, meaning any valid JavaScript code is also a valid TypeScript code - but TypeScript adds optional static Typing interfaces, and advanced tooling features.

2. Why use TypeScript over JavaScript ?
TypeScript ia an open-source programming language developed by Microsoft. It is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing and compiles to plain JavaScript, enabling improved code quality, maintainability, and tooling support in modern web and software development.

3. TypeScript vs JavaScript
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing, allowing developers to define variable types and catch errors during development. It requires a compilation step to convert TypeScript code into standard JavaScript, which browsers can run.

JavaScript is a dynamic, interpreted programming language used primarily for web development. It does not include built-in static type checking and is executed directly by browsers or runtime environments like Node.js.

4. What is tsc ?
tsc stands for TypeScript Compiler. It's the tool that transpiles .ts files into .js files, which browser or Node.js can understand.

Install TypeScript
- npm install -g typescript
- tsc --version
- cd project
- tsc --init

5. What is tsconfig.json
This file tells the TypeScript compiler how to compile your project. It controls options like:
- which files to include/exclude
- What ECMAScript version to output
- Module system (CommonJS, ESNext, etc.)
- Whether to allow JS files, strict typing, etc.

6. Compiling TypeScript Files
- tsc

to automatically recompile when you change .ts files
- tsc --watch
